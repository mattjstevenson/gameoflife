### Run:

```javascript
    npm install npm@latest -g

    npm start

    *outdated*
```

#### This application was an experiment to see if I could recreate the theory of John Horton Conway's "Game Of Life", specifying rules on nodes and their relationships to eachother. Aside some difficulty working out how I might perform these actions in React, this exercise was enlightening and definitely helped me grasp the concepts of Front-End JS (React), much more thoroughly.

###### When the app is launched, there are options for Start/Pause, Speed variables and Seeding. There's also a count of cycles on the bottom.
